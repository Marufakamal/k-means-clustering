# k-means-clustering
Here, I have tried to make a  customer segmentaion or clustering using k-means. A ceratin age group of people's income and their spending score in a shopping mall has been taken into account for doing the clustering. The visualization graphs are the the indicators of how  a centrain income group is spending inthe shopping mall.
